Question:

Create a function that returns true if the first array can be nested inside
the second.

arr1 can be nested inside arr2 if:

arr1's min is greater than arr2's min.
arr1's max is less than arr2's max.

PsuedoCode:

Create a function that takes in two arrays as parameters.
Create 4 storage spaces that stores:
  1) minimum of the first array, named minimum array 1
  2) maximum of the first array, named maximum array 1
  3) minimum of the first array, named minimum array 2
  4) maximum of the first array, named maximum array 2
Find the minimum and maximum of the first array, by comparing each value to the
   minimum array 1 and seeing which one is smaller. If the current value is smaller store
  the value into a minimum array 1, and
Find the minimum and maximum of the second array
Check to see if second arrays minimum is smaller than the first array and
  Check to see if the second arrays maximum is larger than the first array
