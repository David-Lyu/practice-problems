Question:

Create a function that returns true if the first array can be nested inside
the second.

arr1 can be nested inside arr2 if:

arr1's min is greater than arr2's min.
arr1's max is less than arr2's max.

PsuedoCode:

Create a function that takes in two arrays as parameters.
Create 4 storage spaces that stores:
  1) minimum of the first array, named minimum array 1
  2) maximum of the first array, named maximum array 1
  3) minimum of the first array, named minimum array 2
  4) maximum of the first array, named maximum array 2
Find the minimum and maximum of the first array, by comparing each value and
  storing them in the minimum array 1 if the value is smaller than the current
  value. If the values of the array are bigger than its previous one then that
  array gets stored in the maximum array 1.
Find the minimum and maximum of the second array
  same concept of finding the maximum and minimum of the array 1 except
  store them in the appropriate places.
Check to see if second arrays minimum is smaller than the first array and
  Check to see if the second arrays maximum is larger than the first array
  maximum and if the second array minimum is smaller than the first then give the
  function back a value of true.
If one or both are untrue give the function back a value of false.
